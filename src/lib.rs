//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate lock_free_multi_produce_single_consume_ring_buffer;
//!
//! use ::lock_free_multi_produce_single_consume_ring_buffer::*;
//!
//! // For ony one consumer thread.
//! let ring_buffer_consumer = RingBufferConsumer::new(length, number_of_producers);
//!
//! // For each producer thread.
//! let ring_buffer_producer = ring_buffer_consumer.producer(index_less_than_length);
//! ring_buffer_producer.acquire(length);
//! // use buffer
//! ring_buffer_producer.produce();
//!
//! // For each cosumer thread.
//! let (to_write, offset) = ring_buffer_consumer.consume();
//! // use buffer
//! ring_buffer_consumer.release(number_of_bytes);
//!
//! ```
//!
//! ## The following documentation is originally "Copyright (c) 2016-2017 Mindaugas Rasiukevicius <rmind at noxt eu>".
//!
//! Atomic multi-producer single-consumer ring buffer, which supports contiguous range operations and which can be conveniently used for message passing.
//!
//! There are three offsets ("think of clock hands"):-
//!
//! * `NEXT`: marks the beginning of the available space,
//! * `WRITTEN`: the point up to which the data is actually written.
//! * Observed `READY`: point up to which data is ready to be written.
//!
//!
//! ### Producers
//!
//! Observe and save the 'next' offset, then request `N` bytes from the ring buffer by atomically advancing the `next` offset.
//! Once the data is written into the "reserved" buffer space, the thread clears the saved value; these observed values are used to compute the `ready` offset.
//!
//!
//! ### Consumer
//!
//! Writes the data between `written` and `ready` offsets and updates the `written` value.
//! The consumer thread scans for the lowest seen value by the producers.
//!
//!
//! ### Key invariant
//!
//! Producers cannot go beyond the `written` offset
//!
//! Producers are not allowed to catch up with the consumer.
//!
//! Only the consumer is allowed to catch up with the producer, ie set the `written` offset to be equal to the `next` offset.
//!
//!
//! ### Wrap-around
//!
//! If the producer cannot acquire the requested length due to little available space at the end of the buffer, then it will wraparound.
//!
//! The `WrapLockBit` in `next` offset is used to lock the `end` offset.
//!
//! There is an ABA problem if one producer stalls while a pair of producer and consumer would both successfully wrap-around and set the `next` offset to the stale value of the first producer, thus letting it to perform a successful compare-and-swap (CAS) violating the invariant.
//! A counter in the `next` offset (masked by `WrapCounter`) is used to prevent from this problem.
//! It is incremented on wraparounds.
//!
//! The same ABA problem could also cause a stale `ready` offset, which could be observed by the consumer.
//! The algorithm sets `WrapLockBit` in the `seen` value before advancing the `next` and clears this bit after the successful advancing; this ensures that only the stable `ready` observed by the consumer.
